I am an evolutionary biologist and population geneticist, and currently I am a postdoc in the Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology at the University of Ferrara working with Giorgio Bertorelle, Andrea Benazzo and Francesca Raffini (Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn).

I have been previously a postdoc in the Department of Crop Genetics at the John Innes Centre with Saskia Hogenhout and Thomas Mathers.
I received my PhD in the Department of Life Sciences and Biotechnology at the University of Ferrara working with Giorgio Bertorelle. During my PhD I visited the Lohse Lab at University of Edinburgh and the Hughes Lab at Griffith University.
